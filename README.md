1 - Project Overview
--------------------
The project assigned was to create a Flask application using Python, Flask, various modules within flask and then use of other technologies like Jenkins for Builds and Selenium for testing. The application will be able to utilise CRUD functionality within a database (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) in order to manipulate or read data and will have an interface in orer to aid that.

To begin, I created the various planning documentation such as an ERD, a KANBAN board (using TRELLO) to enable tracking of my progress and potential sprints and a risk assessment.

I will also be utilising various technologies for continuous integration such as GIT and Jenkins for version control and webhook integration for the testing of my application builds.

The basic idea for the app is a blog posting board with basic login/signup functions, this will enable me to hit all of the checkpoints for CRUD functionality.

2 - Project Tracking
---------------------

Using KANBAN boards to track my progress from the earlier stages, it became clear as I slowly progressed than I had in fact bitten off more than I could chew for a basic CRUD app with my previous attempt at a project, so in order to ensure a decent attempt, I started from scratch and endeavoured to K.I.S.S. as my previous assessments had taught me. 

starting on wednesday 8th september, I began a new Trello board to replace my overcomplicated first attempt, and below is said board.
